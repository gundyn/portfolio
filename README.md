# Nathan T. Gundy Portfolio

Welcome to the professional portfolio of Nathan T. Gundy, a dedicated software developer and bootcamp graduate with two years of dynamic experience in the tech industry. 

Throughout my professional journey, I've been able to amass a diverse range of skills, with a particular focus on incident management. I've navigated through complex technical incidents, playing a pivotal role in pinpointing issues, troubleshooting errors, and implementing robust solutions. This experience has fostered my ability to work under pressure, think critically, and communicate effectively with various stakeholders.

Being naturally inclined towards innovation and efficiency, I am deeply interested in automation testing. I believe in the power of automation to optimize workflows, enhance accuracy, and ultimately, drive business growth. By leveraging tools like Selenium, I've been able to design and implement tests that increase coverage, speed up development cycles, and improve the overall quality of software.

This portfolio is a testament to my continuous learning ethos and my commitment to excellence in the field of software development. It is not only a showcase of my technical skills but also an embodiment of my passion for creating software that adds value.

As I continue to expand my knowledge and skills, I am especially interested in delving deeper into automation testing. I am eager to take on new challenges, collaborate with like-minded professionals, and contribute to innovative projects in this exciting space.
